Theme 'Carbon' - 2023-03-19 by Lilbud

Port of the original Retropie Carbon theme, originally by Rookervik

Pretty much just a recreation of that theme in the new engine. Only major change is adding metadata labels, and coloring the logos.

Multiple colorSchemes included, as well as auto-switching to a "basic" layout when there is no media
